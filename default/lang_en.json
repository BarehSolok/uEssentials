    	The unturned chat only suports ONE color.
    	The algorithm will check if text contains an determined color, 
    	and will use it, doesn't matter a position in the message.

    	For example:
    		"<red>player joined the game"
    		"player <red>joined the game"
    		"player join<red>ed the game"

    	The default color is Green.
